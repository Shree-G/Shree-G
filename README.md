I am a third year computer science major at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Through learning computer science, I've developed a passion for Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Recommender Systems, and Full Stack CS Development.. I hope to leverage these skills alongside my computer science background to create products that increase automation and efficiency in high throughput workplaces!
