I'm working as a Full Stack Software Engineer for [iFrog Marketing Solutions](https://www.ifrog.com/). Would love to connect and chat about whatever you're building! Reach out!

> **Note:** In case you're wondering, most of my recent projects start with my name — "Shree" — not because I’m a narcissist (I promise), but because it’s a running joke I find hilarious and a small way to show ownership. Shrocial Media, Shrag, Shrebsite… you get the idea.

## Machine Learning

### [Lambertian Photometric Stereo](https://github.com/Shree-G/Lambertian-Photometric-Stereo)

A project that implements Lambertian Photometric Stereo to estimate the surface normals and albedo of an object. This technique reconstructs surface properties from three or more photos of the object under different, known lighting conditions.

**Key Technologies & Concepts:**
* **Field:** Machine Learning, Computer Vision
* **Languages:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib (including `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d`), Pickle
* **Core Concepts:** Lambertian Photometric Stereo, Linear Algebra, Image Data Processing, 3D Visualization, Surface Reconstruction, Depth Maps, Surface Normals
