# Hello, I'm Shree Gopalakrishnan!
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shree-gopalakrishnan-4b2427214/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

I'm a fourth-year Computer Science student at UC San Diego, graduating in June 2025. Passionate about creating
 impactful AI-driven web applications.

I strive to be the best full-stack AI software engineer I can become. My goal is to be able to take an AI product vision and turn it into a functional MVP website/app rapidly — ideally within the span of a day. I'm working towards this by building as many AI-integrated full stack projects as possible.

### Personal Development Rules:
- I don’t use AI tools for something I haven’t manually built before.
- I only deploy code I fully understand and can explain.

I'm currently building an AI-powered shopping app designed to transform how people discover and choose products. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just chat about AI, tech, or cool projects!

I'm also currently seeking a post-graduation role where I can continue pushing my skills and build end-to-end high-impact products. If you think your company or team could be a great fit, please send me an email at shree.hridai@gmail.com!
