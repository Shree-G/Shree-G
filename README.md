I am a third year computer science major at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). My journey in computer science has lef me to develop a passion for Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Neural Networks. I hope to leverage these skills alongside my computer science background to create products that increase automation and efficiency in high throughput workplaces!
